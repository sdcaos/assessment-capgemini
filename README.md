# Server side

1. Navigate into server folder where package.json live.
    1. - ``` npm install ```
    2. - ``` npm run lint ```
    3. - ``` npm run test ```
    4. - ``` npm run dev  ``` 


2. Didnt know well how to do the validation part so did an object of authUsers and save there every sent token and some user details.
- used that token/details to find the currentUser to check the role
- Also used it to check if an api call was sent with old token to refresh it

3. i thing can pass on reactClient folder, was just to check everything going well.
